- The folder `search_algorithm` contains the implementations of the deterministic search alogorithn of Section 4 of the paper (and the heuristic presented in Appendix). Also it contains the execution of these algorith;s on the crypto primitives we considered in Section 6.

- The folder `aes` contains the implementation of the algorithms presented in Section 5 splitting a Boolean circuits into evaluable Boolean functions. Also, these algorithms are applied to the use-case of AES presented at the end of the paper.

- The folder `implementations_crypto_primitives` contains our fork of the library `tfhe-rs` (https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs). It also contains the implementations we present in Section 6 of the paper.
