- The notebook `applications.ipynb` gather all the crypto primitives (except AES) we studied in the paper and run the deterministic search algorithm on thm to find suitable $p$-encodings.

- The notebook `heuristics.ipynb` implement the heuristic (in Appendix of the paper) and run an example of the s-box of ASCON.

- Other python scripts are the implementations of the determistic search algorithm.
